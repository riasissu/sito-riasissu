The Scuola Superiore di Catania was founded in 1998 within the University of Catania.
The entrance exam - aimed at students enrolled in the first year of a three-year or master's degree program - consists of two Classes: the Class of Humanities and Social Sciences and the Class of Experimental Sciences.
Passing the entrance exam guarantees students free board and lodging at Villa San Saverio, as well as financial aid for mobility experiences.
The educational offer of the School is divided into a series of courses, differentiated over the years: instrumental, interdisciplinary, and laboratory courses (for first and second-year students); specialized courses (accompanying research activities from the third year onwards); certified foreign language courses.
Starting from the second year, students are assigned a tutor teacher, who coordinates research activities through training projects in the disciplinary areas designated by the student.
The School promotes periods of stay abroad through specific financial contributions, as well as exchanges at universities and affiliated institutions.
The educational path concludes with the writing of a thesis, valid as a Second Level academic Master's degree.
