Founded in 2008 at the University of Macerata, the "Scuola di Studi Superiori Giacomo Leopardi" is a high-level training institute that complements university courses and nurtures the talent of selected students based solely on merit.
Every year, 10 places are announced for access to the first year of a three-year or single-cycle master's degree program and 2 places for access to the first year of a master's degree program, divided between the two classes of Humanities and Social Sciences.
The educational offer consists of disciplinary and interdisciplinary seminars held by nationally and internationally renowned professors, allowing students to build a broad and transversal knowledge base, preparing them for research activities.
Students enjoy a range of benefits, including: exemption from university fees, free meals at the university canteens in the city, and free accommodation at the Lombroso residence, located within the Matteo Ricci-Li Madou University College and surrounded by greenery.
Students also have the opportunity to participate in exchange programs with prestigious Italian and foreign Schools and are supported by an individual tutor. At the end of the five-year program, upon fulfilling the required criteria and defending a final thesis, the School awards a diploma equivalent to a Second Level Master's degree.
