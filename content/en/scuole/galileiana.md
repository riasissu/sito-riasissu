The Scuola Galileiana was established in 2004 and consists of students who attend degree courses at the University of Padua. The School is divided into three classes: Natural Sciences (14 positions), Moral Sciences (8 positions), and Social Sciences (8 positions). Additionally, registrations for master's degree programs are now open.
The life of the School is marked by internal courses related to the disciplinary areas of the three classes and by events - often open to the public - such as seminars and conferences. The foundational value of the School is collegiality: within the residence, students form lasting friendships.
Those who complete their five-year journey within the School receive a diploma, equivalent to a second-level Master's degree. Students are entitled to mobility bonuses, book purchase bonuses, and free board and lodging throughout their journey; finally, they are supported by a tutor whom they can turn to for any eventuality.
