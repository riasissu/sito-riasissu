The Toppo Wassermann University Advanced School, active since 2004, offers an interdisciplinary training path of excellence, integrating with the study programs of the University of Udine. It consists of two distinct classes: a Humanities class and a Scientific-Economic class (which includes the Medicine and Surgery degree course).
Access is subject to passing an admission competition, which is open to prospective students in their first and fourth years.
The educational offer includes courses and seminars aimed at transversal and participatory learning.
The School provides its students with specialized and interdisciplinary deepening through laboratories, conferences, and cultural events. Economically, exemption from university fees is accompanied by the possibility of free use of university canteen services and accommodation at the eighteenth-century Toppo Wassermann palace. Students also benefit from high-profile tutoring, a mobility bonus for study or research, and a project fund.
The diploma obtained at the end of the course at the School is equivalent to a Second Level Master's degree.
