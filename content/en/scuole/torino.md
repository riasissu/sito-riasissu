The School of Higher Studies of the University of Turin, hereinafter referred to as SSST, offers courses that integrate the educational path followed by students enrolled in the University's Degree Programs.
Admission to the SSST is through a national public competition, exclusively based on merit criteria.
The criteria for remaining in the SSST program consist of attending courses (worth 3 or 6 credits each) and passing the related exams for a total of 15 credits per year for 5 years. Students are required to maintain an average grade of at least 27 out of 30, both in SSST courses and those of the University.
Students who meet the above criteria enjoy:
- Free accommodation in affiliated university residences
- Reimbursement of university fees
- A study allowance.
The School's courses complement those in which students are enrolled, integrating them both in content and teaching methods.
They focus on topics of strong socio-political impact, with particular attention to sustainable development, and are addressed by integrating humanities and natural sciences.
The teaching staff consists of professors from the University of Turin as well as scholars from Italy and abroad, serving as visiting professors.
