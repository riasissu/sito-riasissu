Established in 2011 at "La Sapienza - University of Rome", the SSAS offers a complementary high-quality training program for deserving students enrolled in a Sapienza degree course. Students are hosted at the "L. Serianni" Residence, entitled to a scholarship, and exempt from university fees.
The educational offer consists of:
- two semester-long disciplinary courses chosen from various academic classes;
- an interdisciplinary course on a shared theme, collectively studied with different perspectives and methods, with results presented during the SSAS Symposium;
- an annual research project.
Students are also supported in their academic journey by a tutor chosen from the School's fellows and can participate in national and international exchanges with other Schools. Upon completing a 5-year SSAS program, the School awards a title equivalent to a Second Level Master's degree.
