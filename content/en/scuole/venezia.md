Founded in 2012, the Ca’ Foscari International College is the University Advanced School of the Venetian Ateneo.
Collegiates are hosted at the Camplus residence in the center of Venice. The primary vocations of the College are interdisciplinary studies and internationality.
The official language of the College is English, and the educational offer emphasizes the Anglo-Saxon model thanks to the three minor paths that characterize the three-year educational path.
The cultural program is also complemented by the so-called Labs, short courses with a transversal character, conferences, workshops, and international conferences. Moreover, each student is mentored by a professor from the College's Academic Board.
The College also allows entry to master's students, who can choose to follow a path in humanities or social sciences. The College path also includes a mandatory period abroad for each study cycle, in order to broaden the horizons of its students as much as possible. Selections generally take place in early May for undergraduate students and in July for master's students. The announcement is published one month prior.
At the end of the five-year program, after meeting the requirements and defending a final thesis, the College awards a diploma equivalent to a Second Level Master's degree.
