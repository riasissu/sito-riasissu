Founded in 1999, the ISUFI Advanced School is a University Higher Education Institute of Interdisciplinary Training affiliated with the University of Salento.
Admission to the School is through a merit-based competition, which is announced annually for the three disciplinary areas (economic-legal, technical-scientific, and humanistic-social). It is possible to access the first and second year of Bachelor's/Master's degree programs and the first year of Master's degree programs.
Selected students are offered accommodation at the College, exemption from university fees, and a monthly allowance by the School. The educational offer consists of 2 semester courses of 30 hours each, accompanied by various seminar activities. Additionally, students have the opportunity to attend language courses and must complete a semester of studies abroad.
At the end of the program, after defending a final thesis, the School awards a title equivalent to a Second Level Master's degree.
