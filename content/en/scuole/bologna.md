The Collegio Superiore, founded in 1998 at Alma Mater Studiorum â€” University of Bologna, offers advanced interdisciplinary educational paths to selected students of the University. The teaching is structured into integrated courses, held by professors from various disciplines, and seminars. The students are hosted in the Irnerio residence, located in the center of Bologna, they can participate in exchanges with Italian and foreign Schools of excellence, and receive economic benefits (scholarship and tax exemption) decided annually. Each student is also mentored by a high-profile tutor. At the end of the 5-year Collegio program and upon submission of a final project, the students receive a title equivalent to a Second Level Master's degree. Each year, places are advertised for students in the humanities-economic area and in the scientific-technical area, about to start the first year of a three-year, master's, or single-cycle master's degree program.
